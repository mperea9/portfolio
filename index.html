                    <p class="lead mb-5">Graduated from the University of Colorado at Boulder with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, I have experience mostly in Software Development, particularly with proficiency in Python. I enjoy working with analytics along with databases, data science, and visualization. Since I was a child I have looked up to the scientists and engineers who work with genetic modification technology, following mostly with CRISPr Therapeutics' work. I enjoy a team based setting and am always eager to enjoy time with my team. I focus primarily on furthering my understanding of software engineering and trying to better myself personally along the way, as if I am a "forever student."</p>

                            <p>This is a path finding visualizer tool that helps someone visualize how the A* search algorithm works in real time as it runs, implemented using Python. 
                            The A* Search Algorithm is an extension of Dijkstra's algorithm with Breadth-First characteristics. The A* search also introduces a heuristic into a regular graph-searching algorithm, 
                            essentially planning ahead at each step so a more optimal decision is made, making it one of the more efficient methods in pathfinding and graph traversal. 
                            There are two heuristics of this algorithm, the Manhattan Distance and Euclidean Distance. This implementation uses the Manhattan Distance heuristic.</p>

                            <p>Project was made to help understand connecting a MySQL database and Python Flask server to display a simple list of items on a front-end page. Described as a 3-Tier application (UI, Backend, Database).
                            The objective of the project was to create a grocery store management system that allowed users to add/remove store items while being given full prices and total prices amongst checkout. 
                            Orders and products also received their own personal IDs within the backend server and database.
                            The tier list followed: database being MySQL, the backend being Python on a Flask server, and the front-end being HTML, CSS, and JS while using Bootstrap.
                            This project helped students understand the basic concepts of how businesses run and the different kind of services that can be used.</p>

                    <p>Apart from being a software engineer, I enjoy most of my time making and listening to music. 
                    Generally, I favor the hip-hop genre and its wide amount of subdomains that have branched off from it such as LoFi, GoGo, and Slow-Rhythmic. 
                    My favorite artists include: Frank Ocean, Isaiah Rashad, Saba, J.I.D, and J Cole. 
                    Since I live in Colorado, the weather is usually cold as winter lasts for much of the year, providing plenty of quiet time indoors that allows me to soak in the music.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">When I find myself away from home I enjoy playing sports, specifically Hockey and Lacrosse. 
                    I was an All-American athlete in both sports and was fortunate enough to receive multiple offers from colleges in the process. 
                    I chose a route in hockey involving what we call "Major Juniors" where injuries eventually caused me to stop competitive play. 
                    I wouldn't take anything back or change my path as those sports have provided me fond memories I still cherish. 
                    I'm lucky enough to recreationally be involved in several hockey leagues around the Denver Metro area and I love the community in the state.</p>
